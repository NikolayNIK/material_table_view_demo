# material_table_view demo project

This is the demo project designed to showcase
the [material_table_view](https://pub.dev/packages/material_table_view) package.

## Usage

The demo project is configured to run as a part of the example of the `material_table_view` package.

However, it is possible to reconfigure it to run standalone. To do this, replace the following lines in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
  material_table_view:
    path: ../
```

with:

```yaml
  material_table_view: any # or more specific version if needed
```
