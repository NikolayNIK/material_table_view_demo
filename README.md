# material_table_view demo project

This is a complicated demo project designed to showcase full range of capabilities of
the [material_table_view](https://pub.dev/packages/material_table_view) package. The fewer features you end up using,
the less complicated your code will end up.

## Usage

The demo project is configured to run as a part of the example of the `material_table_view` package.

However, it is possible to reconfigure it to run standalone. To do this, replace the following lines in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
  material_table_view:
    path: ../
```

with:

```yaml
  material_table_view: any # or more specific version if needed
```
